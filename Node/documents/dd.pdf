Instances created before this date require a HighQ account, as described below.\n\xa0\n\nResponding to a site invitation\n\nWhen you have\xa0an account created in Collaborate for the first time, you will receive an email invitation similar to the one above.\n\nThe email will have the branding of the firm or organisation managing that instance of Collaborate.\n\nTo accept the invitation and access the site, click\xa0Please click here to activate your account. Passwords will never be sent via email or otherwise.\nActivating your account\n\nAfter clicking on the link, the\xa0Set your password\xa0screen will be displayed in the browser.\nOn this screen, the user must:\n\nEnter a new password and confirm the password\n\t\nA password must contain at least eight characters. and include at least one number and one uppercase letter.\n\n\nAgree to the terms of use\n\nYou can also choose to be remembered on this computer, which will remember your login and password.\nClick\xa0Set password\xa0to set the password.\n\nBy default, passwords are not set to expire. However, each firm that licenses their own instance of Collaborate may choose to set a password expiration period (such as 90 or 180 days). \xa0After that period of time, on the next login attempt, a user will be asked to change their password. \nTo request that a password expiration period be enabled on an instance of Collaborate, a firm's HighQ liaison should reach out to highq-support@thomsonreuters.com.\nIf you are invited to another site within this instance, you will be asked to log into the system directly, you do\xa0not need\xa0to activate your account again.\n\nEdit profile\nAfter activating a new account, the last step is to confirm your profile information. You are encouraged to complete your profile and to add a picture of yourself that will be displayed as an avatar in different parts of Collaborate:\n\nYou cannot change your organisation and your email address in your profile, but have permissions to change all other aspects of your profile.\nOnce all of the information has been entered, click\xa0Save\xa0to save the details.\nLogging in\nIn the future, when you receive\xa0an invitation to another site or otherwise wish\xa0to access Collaborate, you will need to login, via the\xa0Please click here to login\xa0link in the invitation email. (The login page will have the branding of the firm or organisation managing that instance of Collaborate.) This assumes that you have not chosen to save your login credentials. In that case, you will automatically be logged in.\n\nSome instances do not allow you to save your login credentials, so this option may not appear on all login pages.\n\n\nBy default the\xa0Remember me\xa0option will only work for 100 days, after which it must be reapplied and\xa0a\xa0firm may shorten or lengthen the default period before a remember\xa0me selection expires.\xa0\n\nA System Administrator can set up two factor authentication for some or all accounts that access a site. Instructions on logging in are here.\n\nResetting your password\nIf you cannot remember your password, you can click\xa0Reset your password\xa0to start the reset password process.\n\nIf you fail\xa0to login three times in a row, your account will be locked and you will not be able to login, even with your correct password. \n\nYou will receive a message after your third failed login attempt:\n\nYou have\xa0the option of resetting your password to unlock access to your account.\xa0If necessary, a system administrator can unlock a user's account that has been locked.\n\xa0\n""], 'Breadcrumb_path': ['', '', 'Getting started', '', 'Activate and log in to a HighQ account'], 'Related_materials': ['https://knowledge.highq.com/help/system-administration/single-sign-on-sso-primer', 'https://knowledge.highq.com/help/getting-started/activate-and-log-in-to-a-thomson-reuters-account', 'https://knowledge.highq.com/help/getting-started/change-a-password-in-collaborate', 'https://knowledge.highq.com/help/videos/login-as-a-new-user', 'https://knowledge.highq.com/help/system-administration/user-administration-in-collaborate']}"
