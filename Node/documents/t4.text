'\\nFiles,\\xa0Wikis,\\xa0Blogs and\\xa0Events\\xa0can be configured to require approval before content is uploaded or updated by any user, except an administrator; while the types of content may differ, the approval process remains the same. If\\xa0a file needs approval, the designated administrator will receive a notification.\\nBelow is an example using the Files module:\\nWhen you upload a file\\xa0that requires approval, the following message will be displayed at the top of the page:\\n\\nAll pending files are located via\\xa0My profile\\xa0>\\xa0Approval workflow:\\n\\n\\nWhile the name is similar, this is not to be confused with Workflow, used for task automation.\\n\\nThe\\xa0Approval workflow\\xa0screen is displayed:\\nYou can view the\\xa0files that are Pending approval\\xa0and the files that have been\\xa0Rejected. You can also\\xa0Revoke\\xa0or\\xa0Delete\\xa0the files pending approval from the\\xa0More actions\\xa0menu:\\n\\nIf you choose\\xa0to revoke the file, it is then moved to your\\xa0drafts. In your drafts, you can make any changes and resubmit it for approval or you can delete it altogether.\\nIf the file is submitted for approval, an email is sent to anyone listed as an approver for the\\xa0Files\\xa0module, informing them that\\xa0they have content to approve, with a link to the approval page:\\n\\nAs an approver, click the link to go to the approval page. Within\\xa0the approval page, you can review content within the document viewer.\\xa0You\\xa0can then approve or reject the content\\xa0(along with any other items awaiting approval):\\n\\nIf the content\\xa0is rejected, you will receive\\xa0an email notification and the content will\\xa0end\\xa0up back in your\\xa0Pending approval\\xa0page, flagged as rejected. If you click\\xa0on the\\xa0Rejected\\xa0status, you can view\\xa0the comments related to\\xa0the rejection, the name of the person who rejected the blog post and the time related to the rejection:\\n\\nYou can then either delete the content\\xa0or edit it and resubmit it for approval\\nIf approval is granted, the content is published immediately and you will receive\\xa0an email notification:\\n\\nIf the\\xa0approval workflow is disabled\\xa0for a module\\xa0while there is content waiting to be approved\\xa0(meaning that approval is no longer required), all content awaiting approval will be published automatically.\\n\\n'
